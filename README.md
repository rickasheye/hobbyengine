# how to build
1. put the root directory "openglengine" into another folder
2. download and copy a folder with SFML contents into that "another folder"
3. if that new folder you downloaded isnt "SFML" rename it to so
4. open a terminal inside "openglengine" and type "make" this should create a .exe file on windows (as it is only windows in the makefile)
