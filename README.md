# how to build
1. download and copy a folder with SFML contents into the root folder of this repo
2. if that new folder you downloaded isnt "SFML" rename it to so
3. open a terminal inside "openglengine" and type "make" this should create a .exe file on windows (as it is only windows in the makefile)
(might need to run a quick make clean, since im dirty and dont clean before i upload)

i would really enjoy a pull request here and there as i am constantly improving on this engine i want other people to put there touches to it.
decently enough it should run on linux with a few makefile changes thats it since the code doesnt use any windows code.
