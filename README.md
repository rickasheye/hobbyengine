# how to build
1. put the root directory "openglengine" into another folder
2. download and copy a folder with SFML contents into that "another folder"
3. if that new folder you downloaded isnt "SFML" rename it to so
4. open a terminal inside "openglengine" and type "make" this should create a .exe file on windows (as it is only windows in the makefile)

i would really enjoy a pull request here and there as i am constantly improving on this engine i want other people to put there touches to it.
decently enough it should run on linux with a few makefile changes thats it since the code doesnt use any windows code.
